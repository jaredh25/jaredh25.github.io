### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 my favorite lab we did in class because it was about the game Blackjack, which is a game I love to play, and it was fun being able to code about a game I like to play in my free time.  While doing this lab it really helped me understand how and when to use if statements much better since there were so many that needed to be used depending on the different cards that were given. It also helped me understand how to use or statements, and how to use and statements, when there were multiple requirements within an if statement. The last thing I thought this lab really helped me understand was with calling functions from other files, since all the files in blackjack_functions.cc ended up being called in the file blackjack.cc to calculate the correct added number depending on the cards that were given. 
* Lab 6
    
    Lab 06, part 2 was another one of my favorite labs because I thought it was extremely cool how a computer could take any number of numbers and find the average of all those numbers added up in a fraction of a second. It also made it abundantly more interesting to me since I wrote the code myself which made it feel rewarding every time I ran the code. I felt like while making this lab I learned more about the need of having parenthesis around equations to make sure the order of operations was correct, since even just one addition sign being in front of something would affect the outcome of computers output of the average drastically. I also felt like this lab helped me learn the basis of for loops as well since during this lab it was the first time I’d ever seen one, so after continuously writing one until I got it right and it compiled, it became engrained in my mind how to write a for loop.
* Lab 7
    
    Lastly, lab 7, part 1 was another one of my favorite labs because I enjoyed the high low number game that could be played once the lab was complete. I also found writing the code to be entertaining because there weren’t too many instructions telling me exactly what to write, and I could just come up with a solution on how to make the correct outputs on my own. During this lab I learned how to write a while loop instead of just a for loop. I also learned how to incorporate if statements within loops and how for the if statements that were within loops during this lab, I needed to put break statements so that once the condition was met, the loop would stop and not continue into an infinite loop.
